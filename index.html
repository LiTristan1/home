		<h1>Hold Your Breath</h1>
		<p> Splash!Kick!Dive! Dolphins are the humans of the oceans,seas, and rivers! Why? 
		   Dolphins are intelligent,social,abstract thinking aquatic mammals,  that are capable of experiencing a 
		   considerably large range of emotions, that are similar to that of human beings. One might be wondering, 
		   how is this even possible? and what evidence is there to support these claims about Dolphins?   
		</p>
		<h2> How Intelligent are Dolphins?        </h2>
	    <p>	 Did you know that (relative to body size) dolphins have the 2nd largest brain in the 
	         world? Thus, making dolphins one of the smartest/intelligent beings on planet earth, (dolphins are ranked only second compared to humans, who are ranked first
		    (in terms of brain size relative to body size). This is proven as a pod of dolphins near the coast of Florida have 
		    developed their own fishing technique, which allowed the dolphins to conserve as much of their energy as possible, while
		    maximizing the amount of fish that they are able to catch. Below is the procedure of the dolphin's strategy to catch fish.
		</p> 

		<ul>
			<li> One dolphin would use its tail to kick at the mud located a few meters below relatively 
				 shallow water, as it encircles the school of fish. This is done in order to create clouds of mud
				 that obscure the vision of the fish.
			</li> 
			<li> A second dolphin would then use echolocation as a medium of communicating to the rest 
				 of the pod of dolphins, to trap and catch the escaping fish. 
			</li>          
			<li> After receiving and interpreting the signal from the dolphin mentioned in step 2, the 
				 remaining dolphins of the pod begin to trap and catch the escaping fish.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p> This proves that dolphins are exceptionally intelligent beings as, the fact that
			a pod of bottlenose dolphins were able to devise a plan or strategy in order to increase efficiency and
		    success when catching fish, demonstrates that dolphins are capable of critical thinking, 
		    solving problems, and socializing with one another (the dolphins must have 
		    communicated with one another, in order to create and smoothly execute said plan). However, 
		    these are not the only factors that prove that dolphins are an intelligent species. Another 
		    factor that convince scientists that dolphins are intelligent life forms, is that dolphins are able to
		    have a feeling of both self-awareness and awareness of their surrounding environment . This is shown
		    as, dolphins are one of the only species in the world that have passed the mirror test, which is a 
		    test that proves whether or not an animal could recognize themself, via their reflection in the mirror.
		    The ability of self-recognition is a cognitive ability that is only seen in a few other species of animals
		    such as chimpanzees, elephants, and humans, but what distinguishes the dolphin's self-recognition ability from 
		    other species of animals, is that dolphins develop the ability of self-recognition at around seven months of
		    age, which is 5 months earlier than humans!
		   
		</p>

		<h2>  Dolphins Are Tremendously Social!  
		</h2>

		<p> Did you know that dolphins are usually found in pods that are 2 to 40 dolphins strong?
		   And that is just the tip of the iceberg, occasionally, dolphins can even be found living 
			in a "super pod" which is a pod consisting of hundreds to thousands of members.
		</p>

		<p> In fact, "super pods" can consist of more than one species 
			of dolphin, and as long as the species of dolphins do not compete or fight for the same resource(s), they
			will behave towards one another, as if they were the same species of dolphin. An example of this, would
			be off the Bahamas, where two species of dolphins, the bottlenose dolphin and the Atlantic spotted dolphin 
			interact with one another.
		</p>

		<p> Within a pod of dolphins, kindness and caring, as well as teamwork
		is constantly demonstrated among the individuals in said pod of dolphins. This is shown as,
		dolphins express deep affection for one another, and thus, if given a situation that one
		dolphin in a large pod of dolphins becomes sick, other dolphins in that pod will support said sick
		dolphin both physically and mentally. 
		</p>

	 	<p><b>Note:</b> As demonstrated by the pod of bottlenose dolphins that live near the coast
						for Florida, dolphins also enjoy interacting and "talking" to one another via clicks
						and whistles
		</p>

		<p> Dolphins are not only limited to being social with other dolphins, but in fact,
			dolphins are also exceptionally affectionate, friendly, and social towards
			human beings. This is proven, as demonstrated by dolphins living in captivity, 
		   as they form close relationships and bonds with human beings that work closely with them 
		    such as their trainers (for shows) and researchers that research the dolphins in captivity.
		</p>
		<h2> Dolphins are capable of experiencing a large variety of emotions</h2>
		<p>Did you know that dolphins, similarly to humans, mourn for their dead? This is
           due to the fact that dolphins have the capability to experience and/or
		   undergo the emotions of sorrow and sadness. This is surprising as we often view dolphins
		   as cheerful and playful beings/creatures, a result of their joyful and playful nature, and 
		   thus we do not expect dolphins to portray such negative emotions. In fact, even 
		   rage/anger, and hatred is not unknown among dolphins. When enraged (due to competition over a mating partner),
		   a dolphin will not hesitate to physically abuse or even kill.
