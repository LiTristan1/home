		<h1>Famous Dolphins?</h1>
		<h2>Iceberg</h2>
		
		<h3>Albino Orca</h3>
		<p>The iconic black-and white counter-shading of an orca, allows for us to easily
		identify an orca in the wild, but, have you ever seen a white orca with pink eyes? This is the case for Iceberg, who is a male white-adult-orca. Albinism,
		which is the congenital absence of any pigmentation or coloration in an animal or plant, is
		the cause for such a phenomenon. However, albinism provides many handicaps for the animal with albinism. These include
		a weaker immune system, poorer vision, and lower rate of success when hunting as a result of inability to camouflage with 
		the surrounding environment, which results in increased difficulty for the survival of an albino animal. The rate of births for albino orcas
		is 1 albino orca:10 000 total orca births. in addition to being exceptionally rare, what distinguishes Iceberg from other albino orcas, is that 
	    he is the only male-albino orca, that has survived to the age of sexual maturity.

		<h2>Winter</h2>
		
		<h3>Survival story</h3>
		<p> When winter was two months old, she found herself entangled in a crab trap line, which cut off circulation to 
			her tail flukes, and stranded her in Mosquito Lagoon. Luckily, she was rescued by the Clearwater Marine Aquarium rescue team, who
			disentangled the crap trap line and transported Winter to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium where Winter's extensive injuries were treated.
			However, despite great efforts to save Winter's tail, it continued to rapidly deteriorate until eventually, the Clearwater Marine Aquarium rescue team
			were forced to amputate her entire tail fluke and joint in order to prevent an infection from spreading, and as a replacement, the rescue team attached a 
			prosthetic tail onto where Winter's tail was originally situated. Winter's story of survival is unique, as most dolphins that are entangled in 
			crab trap lines or monofilament do not survive and Winter continues to inspire people to persever through life's toughest obstacles even today, and has been the
			subject of a movie called "Dolphin Tale".Winter currently lives at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium.
