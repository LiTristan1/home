	<p> As evident from the information in the table above, it is evident that the Irrawaddy dolphin,
		Indus River Dolphin, and the Australian Humpback dolphin are on the brink of extinction.Sadly,the examples 
		of critically endangered species of dolphins above, are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to critically 
		endangered species of dolphins. Did you know that around ten(10) species of dolphins are at risk of extinction? Today,humans know of 
		the existence of around 43 species of dolphins, hence that means that about 25% of all the species of dolphins known today, are at risk of
		extinction. In every case, humans are the primary factor, as to why many species of dolphins are endangered.
